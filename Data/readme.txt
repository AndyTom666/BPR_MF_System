This dataset is extracted from Amazon Review data (https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/).
We only preserve four category subsets for experimentation, consisting of 3924 users and 3058 items.
We split the original dataset into train (60%, 78880 user-item interactions), validation (20%, 25055 user-item interactions), and test sets (20%, 25060 user-item interactions). 
All the models ought to share these datasets for training and evaluation.
Each sub dataset is saved in '.txt' format (each row represents a user-item interaction pair).
